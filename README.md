<h1 align="center">MCP Bundler (macOS)</h1>

MCP Bundler is a macOS SwiftUI app for managing and running Model Context Protocol (MCP)
servers, with a headless stdio mode for CLI and automation workflows. The codebase targets
the MCP lifecycle spec baseline dated 2025-06-18.



## Status

I decided to move the project from Paid software to open source thanks to <a href="https://bags.fm/">Bags platform</a>
I need some time to prepare the code for open sourcing it and for allowing to download builds straight from the site and remove license gate.
Bear with me, I need some hours for this.

Until then you can download app here: <a href="https://mcp-bundler.com/downloads/MCPBundler-latest.zip">TEMP DOWNLOAD LINK</a>
